# Userscript: Clean Twitter

Clean and copy the URL to the clipboard by pressing "alt+c". 

The script removes the query string from the URL and redirects to the new URL.

For example: `https://example.com/site?tracking=1234` becomes `https://example.com/site`.

If there is no query string, only the URL is copied.
